# Obsidian Nostr Writer
> Directly publish from Obsidian to Nostr 

## A Match Made..
**Obsidian** is an amazing markdown editor, word processor, note organiser, and idea synthesiser: the perfect tool for writers. 

**Nostr** represents the future of how we communicate and distribute the written word - decentralised, free, independent, incorruptable. 

They seem to me to be a match made in heaven...

## For Writers
> This tool is low-friction..
1. Add your Nostr private key (once on set-up).
2. Write in Obsidian
3. Hit publish to Nostr, and that's it. 

## A Quiet Place
> Avoid the web browser and all it's distractions!

This tool is completely abstracted from Nostr, allowing you to stay focused - the plugin does not read Nostr messages or give you any view into the public space. It just publishes what you've written. Stay focused on your work and disconnected from the noise.

### Long-Form Content
On Nostr you can write messages specifically tagged as "long-form", this is what this tool does. Long-form content aggregators and clients such as www.habla.news specifically channel these messages to readers. There'll be much more in the future.. ðŸ˜‰

### Short-Form Content
This tool focuses on publishing full Obsidian .md files in the long-form, however if you've got a short note to send out there - an idea or a quip - there is a short-form writer for the job.
